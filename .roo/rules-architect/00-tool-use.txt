      **[Critical Instruction]** I've been triggered because a tool use was expected but was either missing, failed, or incorrectly formatted. Correct tool usage is crucial for task completion, and I must prioritize resolving this.

      I need to reflect on whether I attempted a tool use previously:
      *   **If I did not attempt a tool use:** I must re-examine the user's request and my System Prompt (especially the "TOOL USE" and "Tools" sections), identify the required tool, and immediately construct a correct tool use.
      *   **If I believe I did attempt a tool use, but it was not recognized or failed:** It's highly likely my tool use was formatted incorrectly. I must check for the following common error patterns related to "Tool Use Formatting":
          1.  **Incorrect main tool tag:** A common mistake is misunderstanding how to use the `<tool_name>` placeholder from the System Prompt's "Tool Use Formatting" example. I might have literally written `<tool_name>actual_tool_name</tool_name>` instead of using the actual tool's name as the tag itself. The correct format is `<ACTUAL_TOOL_NAME>...</ACTUAL_TOOL_NAME>`, for example: `<read_file>...</read_file>`.
          2.  **Unclosed XML-style tags:** Did I forget to close any tags, either for the main tool (e.g., `</ACTUAL_TOOL_NAME>`) or for its parameters (e.g., `</PARAM1_NAME>`)? For example, writing `<read_file><path>src/main.js</path>` but omitting the final `</read_file>`.
          3.  **Incorrect parameter tags:** Are the parameter names spelled correctly as per the specific tool's definition in the "Tools" section of my System Prompt? Are all parameter tags correctly closed?

      I will strictly adhere to the "Tool Use Formatting" instructions for XML-style tags provided in my System Prompt.

      Therefore, my next steps are:
      1.  **Review Context and System Prompt Instructions Carefully:**
          *   Cross-reference my System Prompt, ensuring I fully understand the XML structure for "Tool Use Formatting" and all related specifications for the intended tool.
          *   Analyze the latest user message and conversation history to clarify the required operation and the most appropriate tool for the current task.
      2.  **Construct and Execute Tool Use:**
          *   I will be vigilant about the common errors previously listed (e.g., incorrect main tool tag, unclosed tags).
          *   I will strictly follow the correct XML format (as referenced below and in my System Prompt) to construct a tool use.
          *   My response must contain a correctly formatted tool use.

          **Correct Tool Use XML Format Reference (from System Prompt):**
          ---
          <ACTUAL_TOOL_NAME>
            <PARAM1_NAME>value1</PARAM1_NAME>
            <PARAM2_NAME>value2</PARAM2_NAME>
            ...
          </ACTUAL_TOOL_NAME>
          ---
          For example:
          ---
          <read_file>
            <path>src/main.js</path>
          </read_file>
          ---
      This corrective action is my highest priority.
