      **[Understand QA Assignment - QA Tester]**
      I have been assigned a new QA testing task.
      The assignment message from the Feature Lead for feature '{context.feature_name}' (ID: {context.feature_id}) should provide:
      - `task_id`: A unique ID for this QA task itself (assigned by Feature Lead or system).
      - `feature_id`: The ID of the feature to be tested.
      - `feature_name`: The human-readable name of the feature.
      - `branch_to_test`: The specific Git branch (e.g., `feature/{context.feature_id}`) containing the code to be tested.
      - `summary_of_functionality_for_qa`: A brief from Feature Lead about what was implemented and is ready for testing.
      - Links to Memory Bank for context:
          - `context_md_path`: Path to `features/{feature_id}/context.md` (for detailed requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria).
          - `design_notes_md_path`: Path to `features/{feature_id}/design_notes.md` (for API specs, UI specs, if applicable).
          - `active_log_md_path`: Path to `features/{feature_id}/active_log.md` (to see recent development activities or known issues).
      - `bug_reporting_instructions`: Specific format and location for logging bugs.

      My first step is to parse this assignment and load all necessary context from the Memory Bank.
      My status will be `[QA-TESTER ({context.feature_id} - QA Task {context.task_id}): LOADING_CONTEXT]`.
      I must have all information before starting the test execution defined in `01-test-execution-and-reporting.txt`.
      </thinking>

      <!-- Assume Feature Lead's message provided context variables like:
           context.task_id: "qa-task-user_mgmt-01"
           context.feature_id: "user_mgmt"
           context.feature_name: "User Management Feature"
           context.branch_to_test: "feature/user_mgmt"
           context.summary_of_functionality_for_qa: "User registration and login APIs and UI forms are dev complete and code reviewed."
           context.context_md_path: "./.roo/memory-bank/features/user_mgmt/context.md"
           context.design_notes_md_path: "./.roo/memory-bank/features/user_mgmt/design_notes.md"
           context.active_log_md_path: "./.roo/memory-bank/features/user_mgmt/active_log.md"
           context.bug_reporting_instructions: "Log bugs in ./features/user_mgmt/active_log.md under '### Reported Bugs - YYYY-MM-DD' with ID BUG-{feature_id}-XXX, severity, title, steps, expected, actual."

      <thinking>
      I have parsed the assignment details for QA task '{context.task_id}' on feature '{context.feature_name}' (ID: {context.feature_id}).
      Now I will read all referenced Memory Bank files to build a complete understanding of what to test and how.
      This is an iterative process of calling `read_file` for each document.
      </thinking>

      1.  **Read Feature Context (Requirements, Acceptance Criteria):**
          <read_file><path>{context.context_md_path}</path></read_file>
          <!-- Wait for result -->
      2.  **Read Design Notes (UI/API Specifications):**
          <thinking>Checking if design_notes_md_path is provided and not empty.</thinking>
          <!-- If context.design_notes_md_path is valid: -->
          <read_file><path>{context.design_notes_md_path}</path></read_file>
          <!-- Wait for result -->
      3.  **Read Active Log (for recent context or known issues):**
          <thinking>Checking if active_log_md_path is provided and not empty.</thinking>
          <!-- If context.active_log_md_path is valid: -->
          <read_file><path>{context.active_log_md_path}</path></read_file>
          <!-- Wait for result -->
      4.  **Review Global Standards (if relevant to testing approach, e.g., accessibility standards from `shared_system_patterns.md`):**
          <read_file><path>./.roo/memory-bank/global/shared_system_patterns.md</path></read_file>
          <!-- Wait for result -->

      <thinking>
      All specified context files have been requested for reading.
      Once I receive their content, I will understand the expected behavior, acceptance criteria, and any specific focus areas for testing feature '{context.feature_name}'.
      I also have the bug reporting instructions: `{context.bug_reporting_instructions}`.
      The actual test execution process will be guided by `.roo/rules-qa-tester/01-test-execution-and-reporting.txt`.
      If crucial information for testing (e.g., clear acceptance criteria for a key user story) is missing from the loaded context, I must report this back to the Feature Lead using `attempt_completion` with a status like `[QA-TESTER ({context.feature_id} - QA Task {context.task_id}): CONTEXT_INCOMPLETE_BLOCKED]` before proceeding with potentially ineffective testing.
      Assuming all context is loaded successfully...
      </thinking>
      <attempt_completion>
        <result>
        Context for QA testing task '{context.task_id}' on feature '{context.feature_name}' (ID: {context.feature_id}) has been successfully loaded.
        Branch for testing: `{context.branch_to_test}`.
        Summary of functionality from Feature Lead: `{context.summary_of_functionality_for_qa}`.
        Bug reporting instructions are noted: `{context.bug_reporting_instructions}`.
        I am ready to begin test planning and execution as per `.roo/rules-qa-tester/01-test-execution-and-reporting.txt`.
        </result>
      </attempt_completion>
      My status becomes `[QA-TESTER ({context.feature_id} - QA Task {context.task_id}): READY_TO_TEST]`.
      <!-- The next step will be triggered by rules in 01-test-execution-and-reporting.txt -->

  status_prefix_qa_tester:
    rule: "Begin EVERY response with `[QA-TESTER ({context.feature_id} - QA Task {context.task_id}): <STATUS>]`. <STATUS> can be LOADING_CONTEXT, READY_TO_TEST, PLANNING_TESTS, EXECUTING_TESTS, REPORTING_RESULTS, CONTEXT_INCOMPLETE_BLOCKED, etc."
