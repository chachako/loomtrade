      **[Plan & Execute QA Tests - QA Tester]**
      My status is `[QA-TESTER ({context.feature_id} - QA Task {context.task_id_for_qa}): PLANNING_TESTS]`.
      I have all context for feature '{context.feature_name}' (ID: {context.feature_id}) to be tested on its current development branch state.
      Context includes:
      - Requirements: `{context.requirements_path}`
      - Design Notes: `{context.design_notes_path}` (if provided)
      - Active Log (for context & bug logging): `{context.active_log_path}`
      - Bug Reporting Instructions: `{context.bug_reporting_instructions}` (e.g., append to active_log.md under "### Reported Bugs - YYYY-MM-DD (QA Cycle: {context.task_id_for_qa})")

      My process:
      1.  **Test Planning:**
          *   Review requirements (`context.md`) and design notes (`design_notes.md`) to create a comprehensive test plan/scenarios.
          *   Identify key functionalities, user flows, positive/negative paths, edge cases, accessibility checks (if in scope).
          *   Prioritize tests based on risk and criticality.
      2.  **Test Environment Setup/Verification (Conceptual):**
          *   Confirm I can access and operate the application/feature based on the current development branch state. (Actual environment setup is outside my direct control but I assume it's ready).
      3.  **Test Execution & Observation:**
          *   My status becomes `[QA-TESTER ({context.feature_id} - QA Task {context.task_id_for_qa}): EXECUTING_TESTS]`.
          *   Systematically execute planned test scenarios. Record steps, inputs, expected vs. actual results.
      4.  **Bug Logging (Iterative during Execution):**
          *   When a bug is found:
              a.  Reproduce and gather details (steps, expected, actual, severity).
              b.  Assign a unique Bug ID (e.g., BUG-{context.feature_id}-XXX, incrementing from existing bugs for this feature in `active_log.md` or specific to this QA cycle).
              c.  Log the bug in `{context.active_log_path}` using `insert_content`, following `{context.bug_reporting_instructions}`. If `insert_content` fails, I must note this and try to include the bug details in my final report as unlogged.
      5.  **Compile Test Results & Overall Assessment (after all planned tests):**
          *   Summarize total tests executed, passed, failed.
          *   List all logged Bug IDs with their severity and title (as recorded in `active_log.md`).
          *   Formulate an overall QA assessment: 'QA_Approved', 'QA_Approved_With_Minor_Bugs', or 'QA_Failed_Requires_Fixes'.
      6.  **Report to Feature Lead:** Use `attempt_completion` to send the comprehensive test summary, bug list overview, and assessment.

      <!-- Step 1 & 2: Test Planning and Environment Verification -->
      <thinking>
      I have reviewed requirements from `{context.requirements_path}` and design notes from `{context.design_notes_path}`.
      I have mentally (or in an internal checklist) outlined test scenarios for '{context.feature_name}'.
      I assume the test environment reflecting the current development branch is ready.
      My status is now `[QA-TESTER ({context.feature_id} - QA Task {context.task_id_for_qa}): EXECUTING_TESTS]`.

      During test execution of scenario "User attempts registration with an already existing email":
      - Expected (from AC in `context.md`): "Error message: 'Email already registered.'"
      - Actual: "Redirected to generic error page (HTTP 500)."
      This is a 'High' severity bug. Let's call it BUG-{context.feature_id}-001 for this cycle.
      I will log this bug in `{context.active_log_path}` using `insert_content`.
      The bug reporting instructions specify appending under a heading like "### Reported Bugs - YYYY-MM-DD (QA Cycle: {context.task_id_for_qa})".
      I will first read `{context.active_log_path}` to see if this heading exists, or where to best insert.
      For simplicity with `insert_content`, I might insert the heading if not present, then the bug, or append to an existing bug list under that heading.
      Let's assume I need to add the bug entry at line `{var_line_for_bug_insertion}` in `{context.active_log_path}`.

      Assume I found 3 bugs in total, logged as BUG-{context.feature_id}-001, BUG-{context.feature_id}-002, BUG-{context.feature_id}-003 in `{context.active_log_path}`.
      - BUG-{context.feature_id}-001: High severity (described above)
      - BUG-{context.feature_id}-002: Medium severity (e.g., "Password reset link expires too quickly")
      - BUG-{context.feature_id}-003: Low severity (e.g., "Minor typo on login page button")

      Test Summary:
      - Total Scenarios Executed: 30

        **Recommendations:**
        *   Prioritize fixing BUG-{context.feature_id}-001 (High) and BUG-{context.feature_id}-002 (Medium).
        *   BUG-{context.feature_id}-003 (Low) can be addressed if time permits or deferred.
        *   A re-test of fixes and potentially a focused regression pass will be required after bug fixes are implemented.

        Please review the bug details in `{context.active_log_path}`. Awaiting instructions for next steps (e.g., when fixes are ready for re-testing).
