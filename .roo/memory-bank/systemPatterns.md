## Coding Patterns

* Frontend: Next.js (React 19), Magic UI, TypeScript.
* Backend: Python (FastAPI), SQLAlchemy (ORM).
* Internationalization (i18n): Planned for both frontend (`next-i18next` or similar) and backend (e.g., `python-i18n`).

## Architectural Patterns

* Agentic Loop (Tool-Using LLM) for the core AI agent.
* Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern using Next.js API Routes.
* Three-tier memory system (Short-term, Mid-term/Operational DB-backed, Long-term/Experiential DB-backed).
* Docker-based containerization for deployment.

## Testing Patterns

* To be defined.
