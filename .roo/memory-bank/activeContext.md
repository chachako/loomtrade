## Open Questions/Issues

*   Need to implement the API key retrieval and decryption logic for tool handlers.
*   WebSocket authentication mechanism needs implementation details.
*   Error handling across services needs refinement.
*   Configuration management for secrets (API Keys, JWT Secret) needs a production-ready solution.
*   Need to add `cryptography` and `ccxt` to `backend/requirements.txt`.
