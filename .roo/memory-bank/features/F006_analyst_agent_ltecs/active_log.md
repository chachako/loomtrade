[2025-05-10 12:16:57] - Detailed planning complete. LTECS strategy's Economic (E) and Seasonality (S) components depend on ToolExecutor (F004) providing tools for macroeconomic calendar events and historical seasonality data. This will be a coordination point with F004 Feature Lead. If tools are unavailable, E & S factors might be deferred or simplified for MVP.
