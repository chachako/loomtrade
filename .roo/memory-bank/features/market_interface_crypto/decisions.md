DECISION-market_interface_crypto-001: [2025-05-09 18:56:18] - MVP Exchange Selection for Initial Integration
**Decision:** For the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) phase, the `market_interface_crypto` feature will prioritize integration with **Binance USDⓈ-M Futures (合约)** API.
**Reasoning:**
*   Binance is a leading exchange with comprehensive API documentation and a widely used Testnet.
*   Focusing on one exchange for MVP allows for deeper integration and more thorough testing of core functionalities.
*   USDⓈ-M Futures are a popular product category for automated trading.
*   This aligns with the initial project requirements to select one or two exchanges for MVP.
**Alternatives Considered:** OKX, Bybit. These can be considered for subsequent iterations after successful Binance integration.
**Impact:** All initial development and sub-task breakdown for market data, order execution, and account management will target Binance USDⓈ-M Futures API.
