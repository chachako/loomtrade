## 1. Overview & Goal
实现 AgentManager 模块，其核心目标是为系统提供对专用 AI Agent (如分析师 Agent、交易员 Agent) 的全面、动态的生命周期管理能力。AgentManager 将负责 Agent 的创建、配置、启动、停止、状态监控以及权限管理。该模块是确保系统可扩展性、可管理性和安全运行的关键组成部分。AgentManager 将主要由 System Orchestrator Agent (SOA) 通过内部工具调用进行交互。

## 2. Detailed Requirements / User Stories

### 2.1 Agent Creation & Initialization
*   **US-AM-001:** As a System Orchestrator Agent (SOA), I want to request the AgentManager to create a new specialized Agent instance (e.g., Analyst, Trader) by specifying its type (e.g., `analyst_ltecs_v1`, `trader_experience_v1`), a unique instance ID, initial configuration parameters (including strategy settings, market focus, API keys if applicable), and a reference to a permission profile ID or a detailed permission set, so that new autonomous agents can be dynamically deployed and configured for specific tasks.
*   **US-AM-002:** As an Administrator (interacting via SOA), I want the AgentManager to support the use of predefined permission profile templates (e.g., "ReadOnly_MarketAnalyst", "Cautious_TrendTrader") during agent creation, so that new agents can be quickly and securely set up with standard permission sets, which can be further customized if needed.

### 2.2 Agent Configuration Management
*   **US-AM-003:** As an SOA, I want to request the AgentManager to update the configuration of an existing, currently **stopped** Agent instance (e.g., modify its strategy parameters, change its market focus, update API keys, or adjust its specific permissions), so that agents can be adapted to evolving requirements or market conditions without needing to be recreated.
*   **US-AM-004:** As an SOA, I want to be able to retrieve the current configuration (including permissions) of any specific Agent instance from the AgentManager, so that its settings can be inspected or backed up.

### 2.3 Agent Lifecycle Control
*   **US-AM-005:** As an SOA, I want to request the AgentManager to start a specific, configured Agent instance, so that it transitions to an active state and begins its operational cycle (e.g., market analysis, data processing, trade execution preparation based on its role).
*   **US-AM-006:** As an SOA, I want to request the AgentManager to stop a specific, running Agent instance, so that it gracefully ceases its current operations, saves any necessary state, and transitions to an inactive state.

### 2.4 Agent Monitoring & Health
*   **US-AM-007:** As an SOA or a dedicated monitoring component, I want to query the AgentManager for the current operational status of any managed Agent instance (e.g., CREATED, CONFIGURED, RUNNING, STOPPED, ERROR, DEGRADED), so that system health and agent availability can be continuously monitored.
*   **US-AM-008:** As an SOA or a dedicated monitoring component, I want to retrieve basic performance and activity metrics for any Agent instance from the AgentManager (e.g., uptime, number of tasks processed, errors encountered since last start, last activity timestamp, resource utilization if feasible), so that operational efficiency and potential issues can be tracked.

### 2.5 Agent Permissions Framework
*   **US-AM-009:** As an AgentManager, when an Agent instance initiates a tool call that is subject to permission checks (as determined by the `ToolExecutor`), I need to be able to efficiently retrieve the detailed permission set for that specific `agent_instance_id` (from its persisted configuration, likely `agent_config.yaml`) and provide it to the `ToolExecutor` for validation, so that actions are performed strictly within authorized limits.
*   **US-AM-010:** As an SOA, when creating or configuring an Agent via the AgentManager, I want to be able to define a comprehensive set of granular permissions for it, including (but not limited to) tradable symbols, maximum position sizes, allowed order types, access to specific tools (e.g., `get_market_data`, `create_order`), ability to modify its own memory, and communication capabilities, as outlined in the system's permission design (`01d_agent_communication_and_permissions.md`), so that each agent operates under strict, role-appropriate, and secure control.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### For US-AM-001 (Create Agent):
*   Given a valid agent type, unique ID, configuration data, and permission set/profile ID,
*   When the SOA requests agent creation via AgentManager,
*   Then a new Agent instance directory and its `agent_config.yaml` (containing the provided config and resolved permissions) are created in the backend cache, and the AgentManager registers the new agent with a 'CREATED' or 'CONFIGURED' status.

### For US-AM-003 (Configure Agent):
*   Given a valid `agent_instance_id` for a stopped agent and a set of valid configuration updates,
*   When the SOA requests agent configuration update via AgentManager,
*   Then the AgentManager updates the corresponding `agent_config.yaml` for that agent, and the agent's status reflects that it's ready to be started with the new configuration.

### For US-AM-005 (Start Agent):
*   Given a valid `agent_instance_id` for a configured, stopped agent,
*   When the SOA requests to start the agent via AgentManager,
*   Then the AgentManager initiates the agent's operational loop (details TBD by agent implementation) and updates its status to 'RUNNING'.

### For US-AM-006 (Stop Agent):
*   Given a valid `agent_instance_id` for a running agent,
*   When the SOA requests to stop the agent via AgentManager,
*   Then the AgentManager signals the agent to cease operations gracefully, and its status is updated to 'STOPPED'.

### For US-AM-007 (Monitor Status):
*   Given a valid `agent_instance_id`,
*   When the SOA queries for agent status via AgentManager,
*   Then the AgentManager returns the current, accurate operational status of the agent.

### For US-AM-009 (Retrieve Permissions for ToolExecutor):
*   Given an `agent_instance_id` making a tool call,
*   When the ToolExecutor requests permissions for this agent from AgentManager,
*   Then the AgentManager correctly retrieves and returns the full, current permission set for that agent instance.

## 4. Scope

### 4.1. In Scope:
*   Definition and management of Agent configuration schema, including a dedicated section for permissions within `agent_config.yaml`.
*   CRUD-like operations for Agent instances (Create, Read Config, Update Config, "Delete" or Deregister).
*   Start and Stop lifecycle management for Agent instances.
*   Basic health status reporting (e.g., RUNNING, STOPPED, ERROR).
*   Basic performance/activity metric reporting (e.g., uptime, task counts).
*   Storage and retrieval mechanism for agent configurations and their permissions.
*   API/interface for SOA to interact with AgentManager functionalities.
*   Interaction point for `ToolExecutor` to query agent permissions.
*   Support for predefined permission profiles/templates.
*   Logging of significant AgentManager actions (e.g., agent created, started, stopped, config changed).

### 4.2. Out of Scope:
*   The internal logic or implementation of the specialized Agents themselves (e.g., Analyst, Trader). This feature focuses on *managing* them.
*   Complex inter-agent communication orchestration (beyond AgentManager's role in starting/stopping or providing config that might contain communication endpoints). Direct Agent-to-Agent messaging is handled by SOA or other mechanisms as per `01d_agent_communication_and_permissions.md`.
*   Advanced/real-time performance monitoring dashboards or UI for agent management (AgentManager provides data, UI is separate).
*   The `ToolExecutor`'s internal logic for *enforcing* permissions (AgentManager *provides* the permissions).
*   The actual implementation of the tools that agents use.
*   Detailed implementation of the backend cache/storage for agent memory beyond defining where `agent_config.yaml` resides.
*   User interface for managing agents (SOA is the primary interactor).

## 5. Technical Notes / Assumptions

*   **Agent Configuration Storage:** Each agent instance will have its configuration, including detailed permissions, stored in a dedicated `agent_config.yaml` file within its own directory in a backend cache (e.g., `{cache_dir}/agent_memory/{agent_instance_id}/agent_config.yaml`), as per [`01d_agent_communication_and_permissions.md`](.roo/blueprints/01d_agent_communication_and_permissions.md:15).
*   **Permissions Model:** The permission structure will follow the granularity examples provided in [`01d_agent_communication_and_permissions.md`](.roo/blueprints/01d_agent_communication_and_permissions.md:25) (e.g., `can_trade_symbols`, `max_position_size_usd_per_symbol`, `allowed_order_types`, `can_access_tools: ["tool_A", "tool_B"]`).
*   **Interaction Protocol:** AgentManager will expose an internal API (likely tool-based for SOA) for all its functionalities.
*   **Atomicity:** Configuration changes should ideally be atomic. Updates to a running agent's configuration are complex and initially out of scope; configuration changes apply to stopped agents.
*   **Agent State:** AgentManager needs to maintain a persistent or recoverable state list of all managed agents and their last known status.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for invalid requests, agent failures during start/stop, configuration issues.
*   **Scalability:** Design should consider the potential for managing a large number of agent instances, though initial implementation may focus on a smaller scale.
*   **Security:** API keys or sensitive data within agent configurations must be handled securely (specific mechanisms TBD, but AgentManager is responsible for their storage as part of config).
*   **Agent Process Management:** The actual mechanism for running agent "processes" (e.g., threads, separate processes, async tasks within a main loop) is an implementation detail of the AgentManager and the agent runtime environment. AgentManager provides the abstraction.
*   **Dependencies:** AgentManager will depend on a logging mechanism and potentially a centralized configuration service for its own settings. It will be a key component used by the System Orchestrator Agent (SOA) and the `ToolExecutor`.
