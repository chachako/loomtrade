# Design Notes: Agent Memory Service (ID: agent_memory_service)
*Initialized by Feature-Lead on 2025-05-12 00:22:31*
*This document will be populated by relevant Coder modes during design sub-tasks and reviewed by Feature-Lead.*

## 1. API Design
*(Details of new or modified API endpoints, request/response schemas, authentication, etc. This will detail the internal API/methods the AgentMemoryService exposes for the ToolExecutor.)*

## 2. UI/UX High-Level Design Notes
*(Key UI components, user flows, wireframe references, state management considerations for frontend features. Likely N/A for this backend service, but section kept for consistency.)*

## 3. Key Data Structures / Models
*(Important data models or structures specific to this feature, beyond global models. E.g., structure for representing file paths, content, or operation status.)*

## 4. Other Technical Design Considerations
*(E.g., specific algorithms, third-party service integration details, non-functional requirements impacting design, error handling strategies, file locking mechanisms if concurrent access is a concern.)*
