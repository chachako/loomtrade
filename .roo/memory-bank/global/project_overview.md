## 1. Project Goal & Vision
Vibetrade aims to be a user-friendly, automated multi-asset trading platform (initially focusing on cryptocurrency and stock markets for MVP) leveraging advanced Large Language Model (LLM) Agent technology. It empowers users to define and execute personalized trading strategies through natural language, creating a new generation of "AI Traders".

The core idea is to build an AI Agent that:
*   Understands user-defined trading intentions and strategies (via natural language or a structured interface).
*   Interacts with external environments (exchange APIs, market data sources, indicator libraries) by calling a predefined set of "trading tools".
*   Autonomously makes trading decisions based on LLM reasoning, tool-returned information, and user-set strategies.
*   Provides a transparent decision-making process and a user-friendly interactive interface.
*   Learns from past trading activities stored in a database to refine future decisions.

## 2. Scope
### 2.1. In Scope (MVP Focus):
*   Development of a robust AI Agent for cryptocurrency (futures/contracts) and stock market trading.
*   Natural language strategy definition capabilities.
*   Core toolset for market data retrieval, technical indicator calculation, account management, and order execution for crypto and stocks.
*   User dashboard for monitoring, interaction, and viewing agent's "thought process".
*   TradingView chart integration.
*   Database-driven storage for agent memory, trade history, and configurations.
*   Essential risk management features.
*   Support for Typescript, React 19, pnpm for frontend.
*   Support for Python, FastAPI, uv package manager, ruff linter for backend.
*   No user registration/login mechanism for MVP.
### 2.2. Out of Scope (for MVP, potential future):
*   Support for other financial markets (e.g., forex, commodities) beyond crypto and stocks.
*   Advanced learning mechanisms like complex backtesting engines or community strategy sharing.
*   Mobile application.
*   User registration and login system.
