## 1. Project Goal & Vision
Project Name: Vibetrade

To build a highly modular, extensible, and universal AI trading agent system driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), designed for automated and sustainable profitable trading.
The system will initially focus on the cryptocurrency contracts market (starting with Binance) and possess the capability to seamlessly expand to other financial markets such as stocks and forex in the future.
Core agents, including specialized Analyst Agents for crypto market analysis and Trader Agents with final decision-making authority, will operate efficiently through clearly defined collaboration and communication mechanisms, continuously learning and evolving using shared and independent memory based on YAML/Markdown.
A key feature is the user's ability to interact with the System LLM (System Orchestrator Agent - SOA) via natural language to:
    - Define complex trading strategies (e.g., 'If BTC 15-min RSI < 30 and MACD histogram is positive, open long with 2% capital. SL at 1.5x ATR, TP at 3x initial risk.').
    - Create and manage their own custom agents.
    - Delegate tasks to agents (e.g., 'Act as a cautious manager for my altcoin portfolio, scan every hour for mid-cap altcoins with strong momentum, enter on strong bullish signals confirmed by at least two indicators with small positions (1-2% of sub-portfolio), dynamically adjust TP, and use trailing stops.').
    - Set up monitoring and alerts (e.g., 'Monitor the market every five minutes and send potential trading opportunities to me via Telegram.').
The SOA will interpret these natural language instructions, identify necessary actions, and trigger corresponding operations by utilizing a comprehensive and robust toolset.
The system will interact with the external environment through a strict XML-style tool call protocol, ensuring operational precision and controllability, ultimately providing users with a powerful, transparent, and adaptable personalized intelligent trading partner.
