## 1. Project Goal & Vision
Project Name: Vibetrade

Vision: Based on advanced Large Language Model (LLM) Agent technology, build a user-friendly automated trading platform for cryptocurrencies and stocks. Empower users to define and execute personalized trading strategies through natural language or structured interfaces, realizing a new generation of "AI Traders". The MVP phase focuses on cryptocurrency and stock markets, providing core Agentic Loop trading functionality and transparent decision-making processes.

## 2. Scope
### 2.1. In Scope (MVP)
*   AI Agent core trading loop, supporting cryptocurrency and stock markets.
*   User configuration of API Keys (for trading markets and LLM providers) via UI.
*   User selection of preset trading styles.
*   Simplified user definition of trading strategies (basic indicators, stop-loss, take-profit).
*   Automated trade execution by the Agent (opening, closing positions, stop-loss/take-profit).
*   User Interface (Next.js with React 19, Typescript, Magic UI, Pnpm) to display:
    *   Current positions and trade history.
    *   Embedded TradingView charts for market data.
    *   Chat interaction with the Agent.
    *   Agent's "inner monologue" (thinking log) for decision transparency.
*   Backend (Python with FastAPI, uv, ruff) to implement:
    *   Core Agent logic and Agentic Loop.
    *   Tool execution.
    *   Interaction with exchange/broker APIs and LLM APIs.
*   Database (PostgreSQL) for storing configurations, trade history, etc.
*   Basic risk controls (e.g., maximum position size).
*   Essential toolset for market data retrieval, indicator calculation, and order management.

### 2.2. Out of Scope (MVP)
*   User registration and login system.
*   Financial markets other than cryptocurrency and stocks (e.g., Forex).
*   Advanced strategy backtesting engine.
*   Complex Agent learning and evolution mechanisms (e.g., full trade reflection, parameter self-adaptation beyond basic data logging).
*   Advanced natural language strategy definition (MVP will be a simplified version).
*   Combined strategies or multi-Agent coordination.
*   Community features or a strategy marketplace.
*   Mobile applications.
*   Message queues (unless strictly necessary for core MVP functionality).
*   Advanced text analysis tools (e.g., sentiment analysis, text summarization for news).

## 3. Key Stakeholders
*   Project Sponsor/User (You)
*   Development Team (LLM Team, Project Manager Mode, Architect Mode, Feature Lead Modes, Developer Modes, QA Mode, etc.)

## 4. High-Level Risks & Issues Log
*(Format: - [YYYY-MM-DD] [Risk/Issue ID] Description - Status: Open/Mitigating/Resolved - Owner: Mode/User - Impact: High/Medium/Low)*
*No risks or issues logged yet.*

## 5. Assumptions & Dependencies
*   Availability and reliability of selected exchange/broker APIs for crypto and stock markets.
*   Availability and reliability of selected LLM provider APIs.
*   Technical feasibility of integrating TradingView charts as per requirements.
*   User has access to necessary API keys for exchanges/brokers and LLM services.
*   The provided technical draft (`.roo/draft_technical_specs.md`) serves as a foundational reference but will be superseded by Memory Bank documentation and iterative planning.
