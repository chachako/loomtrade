### [2025-05-10] Decision ID: D-001: Coordination Mechanism for Updating shared_system_patterns.md
**Decision:** A hybrid approach will be adopted for updating the [`./.roo/memory-bank/global/shared_system_patterns.md`](./.roo/memory-bank/global/shared_system_patterns.md) file.
1.  **Feature Lead Responsibility:** Relevant Feature Leads are responsible for identifying potential shared patterns, standards, or conventions during their feature's design and development phases.
2.  **Reporting:** Feature Leads will proactively report these potential shared patterns to the Project Manager.
3.  **Coordination & Approval:** The Project Manager will coordinate with the Architect Mode (if designated for the project) or directly evaluate the proposed patterns for suitability and consistency with the overall project architecture.
4.  **Updating & Notification:** Upon approval, the Project Manager or Architect Mode will be responsible for formally adding or updating the content in [`shared_system_patterns.md`](./.roo/memory-bank/global/shared_system_patterns.md).
5.  **Communication:** After any update to [`shared_system_patterns.md`](./.roo/memory-bank/global/shared_system_patterns.md), all relevant Feature Leads and project stakeholders will be notified of the changes.

**Rationale:** This approach ensures that domain-specific insights from Feature Leads are captured, while maintaining architectural coherence and quality through oversight from the Project Manager and/or Architect. It balances distributed contribution with centralized quality control.
