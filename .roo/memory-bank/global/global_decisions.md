### [2025-05-08] AD_001: Initial System Architecture and Core Technology Choices for MVP

*   **Decision:**
    1.  **Overall Architecture:** Adopt a Monolithic Backend (Python/FastAPI) combined with a Next.js application (serving as UI and BFF) for the MVP phase of Vibetrade. Real-time communication will be handled via WebSockets integrated into the FastAPI backend.
    2.  **Frontend State Management:** Select **Zustand** for global client-side state management.
    3.  **Frontend Data Fetching:** Select **SWR** for client-side data fetching and caching.
    4.  **Backend ORM:** Select **SQLAlchemy** (version 2.x) as the Object-Relational Mapper for database interactions with PostgreSQL.
    5.  **Deployment Strategy (Initial):** Plan for **Docker** containerization for both frontend and backend services to ensure consistent environments and facilitate deployment to various cloud providers or on-premise setups.

*   **Rationale:**
    1.  **Monolith for MVP:** Simplifies development, deployment, and operational overhead for the initial MVP, allowing for faster iteration. The MVP scope is focused and does not immediately necessitate a microservices architecture. The structure still allows for logical modularity within the monolith.
    2.  **Zustand:** Lightweight, simple API, minimal boilerplate, and good performance characteristics, making it suitable for rapid development in Next.js for MVP.
    3.  **SWR:** Developed by Vercel (creators of Next.js), offers excellent integration, caching, revalidation strategies, and is lightweight, aligning with MVP goals.
    4.  **SQLAlchemy:** A mature, powerful, and widely-used ORM in the Python ecosystem. It provides robust features for interacting with PostgreSQL and supports asynchronous operations well with FastAPI.
    5.  **Docker:** Industry standard for containerization, providing portability, consistency across environments, and simplifying the deployment process.

*   **Alternatives Considered:**
    1.  **Overall Architecture:** Microservices (considered too complex for MVP), Serverless functions (might be an option for specific parts later, but not for the core backend in MVP).
    2.  **Frontend State Management:** Redux Toolkit (more feature-rich but also more boilerplate, potentially overkill for MVP), Context API (simpler but less structured for global state).
    3.  **Frontend Data Fetching:** React Query (TanStack Query) (very capable, similar to SWR, SWR chosen for slightly lighter feel and Vercel ecosystem alignment).
    4.  **Backend ORM:** Django ORM (tied to Django framework), Tortoise ORM (async-first, good alternative but SQLAlchemy is more established), Pydal (simpler, but SQLAlchemy offers more features).
    5.  **Deployment Strategy:** Direct deployment to VMs, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) specific solutions (Docker offers more flexibility).

*   **Implications:**
    1.  The monolithic approach requires careful internal structuring to maintain modularity and avoid tight coupling that could hinder future scalability or a shift to microservices if needed.
    2.  Zustand and SWR are well-suited for React/Next.js and should integrate smoothly.
    3.  SQLAlchemy is a powerful ORM; developers will need to be familiar with its patterns and best practices.
    4.  Docker adds a layer of abstraction but also requires Dockerfiles and image management.
    *   Clear API contracts between frontend (Next.js BFF) and backend (FastAPI) are crucial.

*   **Status:** Decided
