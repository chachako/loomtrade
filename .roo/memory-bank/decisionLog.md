*

## Decision

* Initialized Memory Bank.

## Rationale

* To maintain project context and facilitate collaboration.
* As per user request and standard operating procedure for Architect mode.

## Implementation Details

* Created `productContext.md` with initial content derived from `project_bible.md`.
* Created `activeContext.md` with initial status.
* Created `progress.md` with initial task list.

[2025-05-07 20:49:46] - [Decision: Created `docker-compose.yml` for service orchestration]
Rationale: To define and manage the multi-container application services (frontend, backend, database) for local development and testing, as per project requirements.
Implementation Details:
  - Defined three services: `frontend` (Next.js), `backend` (FastAPI), and `db` (PostgreSQL).
  - Configured build contexts, ports, environment variables, volumes for hot-reloading, and network settings.
  - Ensured `frontend` depends on `backend`, and `backend` depends on `db`.
  - Used a named volume `postgres_data` for database persistence.
  - Established a custom bridge network `vibetrade_network` for service communication.

[2025-05-08 01:12:00] - [Decision: Adopted `pnpm` as the package manager for the frontend (`frontend/`) Node.js project.]
Rationale: User preference and to ensure consistent dependency management practices for the frontend. `pnpm` offers benefits like efficient disk space usage and faster installations.
Implementation Details:
  - User preference for `pnpm` was explicitly stated.
  - This decision has been recorded in `.roo/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` to document it as a coding pattern.
  - Relevant Roo rules (in `.roo/rules-code/02-dependency-and-library-management.txt`) have been updated/created to automate `pnpm install` after `package.json` changes in the `frontend/` directory.
  - Project documentation (`blueprints/technical_specs.md`) has been updated to reflect this choice.

[2025-05-08 01:50:38] - [Decision: Adopted FastAPI's native WebSocket support and a ConnectionManager for backend WebSocket communication.]
Rationale: FastAPI provides robust and efficient WebSocket handling. A `ConnectionManager` class (`backend/app/services/websocket_manager.py`) was implemented to encapsulate the logic for managing active WebSocket connections, broadcasting messages, and handling individual client connections, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code. This aligns with Task 1.3.5 (Backend).
Implementation Details:
  - Created `backend/app/services/websocket_manager.py` containing the `ConnectionManager` class.
  - Created `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/websocket.py` with a WebSocket endpoint `/ws/{client_id}` utilizing the `ConnectionManager`.
---
[2025-05-08 01:56:27] - [Decision: Integrated WebSocket API router into the main FastAPI application]
Rationale: To make the WebSocket endpoint (`/ws/{user_id}`) defined in `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/websocket.py` accessible. WebSocket routers are typically included directly in the main application instance rather than under a versioned API prefix like `/api/v1/`.
Implementation Details:
  - Imported `websocket` from `backend.app.api.v1.endpoints` in `backend/app/main.py`.
  - Added `app.include_router(websocket.router, tags=["WebSocket"])` to `backend/app/main.py` after the inclusion of `api_router_v1`. This ensures WebSocket traffic is routed correctly.

[2025-05-08 02:05:11] - Decision: Created ToolExecutor Framework.
Rationale: To provide a structured and extensible way to handle tool execution requests from the LLM, dispatching them to appropriate handlers based on market type. This promotes modularity and simplifies adding support for new markets or tools.
Implementation Details:
- Created `BaseToolHandler` abstract class (`base_tool_handler.py`).
- Created `CryptoToolHandler` and placeholder `StockToolHandler` (`crypto_handler.py`, `stock_handler.py`).
- Created `tool_registry.py` to map market types to handlers.
- Created `executor.py` containing the `ToolExecutor` class for dispatching calls.

[2025-05-08 02:07:55] - Decision: Implemented `get_historical_klines` tool in `CryptoToolHandler`.
Rationale: To enable the Agent to fetch historical market data, which is fundamental for technical analysis and strategy execution. Used `ccxt` library for broad exchange compatibility.
Implementation Details:
- Added `_get_historical_klines` async method to `CryptoToolHandler`.
- Used `ccxt.async_support` for asynchronous API calls.
- Implemented parameter handling for `symbol`, `interval`, `limit`.
- Added basic error handling for `ccxt.NetworkError` and `ccxt.ExchangeError`.
- Formatted OHLCV data into a list of dictionaries.
- Included placeholder logic for exchange instantiation (needs API key handling).
- Added comment reminder to install `ccxt`.
---
[2025-05-08 02:10:48] - Decision: Implemented `get_current_ticker_info` tool in `CryptoToolHandler`.
Rationale: To allow the Agent to fetch real-time price and summary information for one or more trading symbols, crucial for quick market assessment and decision making. Leveraged `ccxt`'s `fetch_tickers` method.
Implementation Details:
- Added `_get_current_ticker_info` async method to `CryptoToolHandler`.
- Handles receiving single symbol string or list of symbols as input.
- Uses `exchange.fetch_tickers` for efficient multi-symbol fetching.
- Formats the returned ticker data into a standardized dictionary structure containing common fields like `last`, `high`, `low`, `bid`, `ask`, `percentage`, `baseVolume`, `quoteVolume`.
- Includes basic error handling for network and exchange errors.
